Hello, my name is Dr Alexander Gardner-McTaggart 

00:00:09.397 --> 00:00:13.663
and I am the academic theme lead for flexible learning at this university.

00:00:14.732 --> 00:00:18.631
This work engages me between the three faculties and

00:00:18.776 --> 00:00:24.043
our transnational programmes and continuing professional development

00:00:24.176 --> 00:00:28.308
aimed at online learners studying with The University of Manchester,

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:34.528
whether these be professionals, carers, or those who live in different parts of the world. 

00:00:35.428 --> 00:00:38.847
With the demands of modern day life, The University of Manchester 

00:00:38.885 --> 00:00:43.095
has created an outstanding suite of online Masters programmes 

00:00:43.096 --> 00:00:45.644
tailored to fit around your needs, 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.536
your professional commitments and family life.

00:00:50.728 --> 00:00:53.540
Manchester has incredible potential 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.535
to serve the professional leaders of today (and tomorrow), 

00:00:56.812 --> 00:01:00.356
but also disadvantaged groups and demographics 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.676
through its growing flexible palette of courses and programmes, 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.438
and I am excited to be able to support this with my experience

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.439
and knowledge of a lifetime in international education. 

00:01:14.812 --> 00:01:18.836
I am so proud to be able to welcome you to our amazing university 

00:01:19.348 --> 00:01:23.324
