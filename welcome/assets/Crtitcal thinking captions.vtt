Being critical is a vital component of the academic process

00:00:09.917 --> 00:00:12.784
and when employed it will result in you gaining 

00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:15.648
a thorough and deeper understanding of your discipline. 

00:00:16.096 --> 00:00:21.280
You will need to use critical thinking strategies when you research and create your assignments.

00:00:22.464 --> 00:00:24.992
So, why do you need to do this?

00:00:25.696 --> 00:00:30.144
Critical thinking is all about thoroughly researched and well thought through arguments

00:00:30.432 --> 00:00:32.541
avoiding preconceptions and bias.

00:00:32.925 --> 00:00:35.481
For example, you would need to avoid 

00:00:35.616 --> 00:00:37.987
avoid basing work on your personal opinions

00:00:38.027 --> 00:00:41.498
about a brand, political ideals or a company.

00:00:42.688 --> 00:00:46.848
Being a student is about learning how to think, not what to think.

00:00:47.872 --> 00:00:50.298
Critical thinking shapes your own values

00:00:50.401 --> 00:00:54.179
and attitudes through a process of consideration and discussion.

00:00:54.486 --> 00:00:58.208
Developing these skills will be critical to your success.

00:00:59.168 --> 00:01:00.256
What does this mean?

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.781
Being critical does not just mean finding fault.  

00:01:05.005 --> 00:01:10.784
It means assessing evidence from a variety of sources and making reasoned conclusions. 

00:01:11.456 --> 00:01:13.862
Critical thinking will support you to:

00:01:14.064 --> 00:01:19.167
Evaluate evidence and arguments for and against views, opinions and theories.

00:01:19.318 --> 00:01:21.686
Consider issues carefully.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.232
Explore where the viewpoint leads, what the conclusions are and if they are logical.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.064
Examine in detail identifying how arguments relate to each other.

00:01:32.672 --> 00:01:36.470
Check for accuracy and identify flaws in reasoning, 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.330
evidence or conclusions.

00:01:38.611 --> 00:01:42.162
Compare the same issue from different authors’ opinions.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.138
Explain why different authors arrived at different conclusions.

00:01:46.688 --> 00:01:51.424
Be able to argue why one set of opinions is preferable to another.

00:01:51.936 --> 00:01:53.664
Look for hidden assumptions.

00:01:55.424 --> 00:02:00.768
Before you start researching a question or topic, ask yourself the following questions:

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.914
What do you want to get out of your research?

00:02:04.381 --> 00:02:06.076
What are your expectations?

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.861
What is your goal?

00:02:08.371 --> 00:02:09.702
What are your limits?

00:02:10.082 --> 00:02:13.726
What do you think the main arguments of the text will be?

00:02:15.456 --> 00:02:18.995
Learning to think critically and critically evaluate work 

00:02:19.107 --> 00:02:20.975
is a skill that needs practice

00:02:21.245 --> 00:02:24.099
and does not always come naturally to everyone.

00:02:24.448 --> 00:02:28.416
