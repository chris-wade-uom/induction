00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.100
Hi, my name is Stella. I work in IT services, and I'm just going to take a few minutes 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.200
today to tell you about some of the services. We provide for students here at the 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.600
University, your it account allows you to access most of the University services 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:21.400
such as on campus Wi-Fi. Email my Manchester, your coursework and lots more. You 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.500
will have already used the ID account manager as the first part of your registration, 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.900
but you can also use it to set up your account recovery details. Change your 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.400
Password and find out more information about your account, your it username might 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.200
look like a random jumble of letters and numbers now, but once you've typed in a 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.200
few times, you won't forget it. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.600
The best way of getting Wi-Fi at the university is to use eduroam. This is a secure 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.000
International Wi-Fi, service available to all staff and students at the University 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.900
of Manchester. It could also let you connect to the internet at any University, 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.600
where eduroam is available. 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.800
Eduroam is the most convenient Network for students and staff after initial setup. 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.900
Eduroam remembers who you are so you don't need to type in your username and password 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.100
every time you access the network. 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.800
You can also look into the uom Wi-Fi network with your University details. However, 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.700
you'll have to log in every time you use this service. Whereas you only need to 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:30.700
set up eduroam. Once Hornet is our Halls of residence internet service in University 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.100
owned Halls. You can connect to the eduroam network, like you would anywhere else. 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.000
On campus wired connectivity is also available. If you need any help with internet 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.700
access and halls, there is a team of hornet reps. 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.000
A university student so you can answer your questions and solve your connectivity 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.700
problems, whether it's for your studies or leisure. 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.000
It support staff can help you with software setup, troubleshooting, and general 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.500
advice. We work closely with the libraries, IT staff and we're happy to advise you 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.500
about how to get set up, and using University services with your own equipment. 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.199
We know that smartphones and tablets are really important to our students. So we 

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:14.700
can also help with setting up your University email on your phone. But probably 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.400
the topic we get asked to help with the most is setting up laptops phones and tablets 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.600
on our edge around. Wi-Fi network. We do have instructions on our website showing 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.300
you how to do it, but the support staff are more than happy to help you get set 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.100
up on Wi-Fi, if you need help with this. 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.900
Boots lecture, Theatres feature Recording Technology, which automatically uploads 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.100
lectures and other presentations, onto the video portal, allowing students to replay 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.600
revisits and revise them for a later date. 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.100
We have many student computers in our PC clusters across campus some of which are 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.000
available for any student to just jump on and use anytime. You can remotely connect 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.200
to some of them from your own computer or tablet. So you can use specialist University 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.300
software without having to visit a PC cluster in person. 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.600
All of you have University email address, which is used for a lot of University 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.100
related communication. I know you'll all have your own personal email accounts, 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.200
but it's a good idea to make sure you regularly. Check your University email. It's 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.700
a standard Microsoft 365 accounts, which you can access through a web browser or 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.100
the mail app on your phone. 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.100
And talking about Microsoft 365, students and staff, get a free copy of Microsoft 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.300
Office to use on their own personal equipment that includes word, PowerPoint Excel, 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.700
OneNote, and more feature, downloads your computer or mobile device. You can use 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.000
Microsoft teams for chat scores and collaboration on documents and files as well. 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.200
Also depends on your course, you might have other software available to you have 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.500
a chat with the school office or lecturers and their be able to point you in the 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.500
right direction. 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.600
Printing. Documents is very easy. You can print from your own laptop phone or tablet 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.700
or from one of our PC clusters. We've got lots of student printers spread across 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.400
the university and like the computers in the PC cluster. Many of these are available 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.000
for students to use. When you log into a cluster computer. You can click print in 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.600
the application. You want to print from tap, your student card, on any of the Xerox 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.900
multifunction devices, which are a combined printer scanner and copier and scanner. 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.100
Select the document that you want to print. 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.000
One of the most important things I want to talk about today. We've got online storage, 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.700
and we suggest that you use it. We've all got USB flash drives, and they're really 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.800
convenient, but they can get lost, and then get broken and they can get stolen. 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.200
The same goes for think computers. So, you should always make sure you keep a copy 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.900
of your work on your online network storage, which you can access through the documents 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.100
folder on a computer. In one of our PC clusters, all through the tools menu in my 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.900
Manchester. 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.100
You've also got one terabyte of storage space with OneDrive which you can access 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.000
through your web browser. If you're working on documents, you may actually prefer 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.200
to edit them in the web-based version of Word, PowerPoint Excel and so on. 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.000
The have unfortunately being cases in the past where students have lost the only 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.800
copy of their work, because didn't back it up and schools, won't accept this as 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.000
a legitimate reason for not handing in your work. You should always keep multiple 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.300
copies of your work in multiple locations. We really don't want to see you lose 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.600
days months weeks or even years of work because it's the only copy that you had. 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.800
Towards the end of this year. We will be introducing something called two-factor 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.000
authentication as an additional step, when logging into certain University Systems, 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.600
and services, including University email, Microsoft 365, and Blackboard, this extra 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.700
layer of security has been in place for staff and postgraduate researchers for nearly 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:00.500
four years now. And he's been extended to all students to provide further protection. 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.200
Our two Factor authentication Service is provided by Duo and easiest way to use 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.700
it is by 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.300
A mobile phone using the Geo app. When the time comes, you'll receive emails from 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.300
us about what you'll need to do and how to get set up in advance. 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.400
There's lots more information and using all of our services on our website. WE Post 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.700
news and announcements all the time through Twitter. So if there's something that 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:30.000
you need that you need to be aware of, there's a place to get the latest news and 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
updates. Although it's not constantly monitored. There are other appropriate methods 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.400
of support if you need, I see help. 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.200
You can get in touch with us to ask for help, ask questions, or reports a fault 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:48.500
or some general feedback. We have a telephone line, which runs 24/7 and there's 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.200
the support portal, which allows you to log a query through your web browser with 

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:57.800
lots of information and step-by-step instructions. And there's also it walk up support 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.600
at the main library and the Alan Gilbert learning Commons. 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.400
Finally, and importantly, an extremely important thing to remember is that your 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:10.600
it account is valuable and criminals, know it in the past and many people from various 

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.900
universities. Including ourselves have received emails from scammers who were trying 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:20.000
to get various personal details about people, like you such as it, login details 

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.800
or banking information. We can't block a lot of these fake emails, but unfortunately, 

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:30.200
there's no way of blocking 100% of them. So always be suspicious of any messages 

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.100
which trying to get pregnant. 

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:35.900
Private information from you that goes for University details and your personal 

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:40.500
details to if you get emailed you're not sure about. It's always best to check with 

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.000
your supervisor school office or us.
